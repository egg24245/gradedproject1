while having already coded alot of the intended features before this edit,the intent is to create a clear to navigate wesbite on the surface level aswell as one that is easy to assess on a code level,therefore ive done my best to keep the things seperated and/or together in the ways i believe to be efficient,i am open to and would appreciate feedback on how this could be more efficient or clean as i do expect there to be ways.

i also intend for the site to be eye catching in some regard while not being overbearing,i feel the addition of different appealing enviroments was a good one to assist in this.

my first main focus was tackling the nav bar as i feared it would be difficult,it was.i intend to add a button that returns to the top of the page,perhaps another social media link and to achieve smooth scrolling,also for the nav links to take me to designated places

i now intend to use absolute positioning to overlay text onto an image
